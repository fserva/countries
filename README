These are two miniature tools intended to help with the task of finding what country are given GPS coordinates in.

The tools are:

 -- copyshapes.py
 Filter country shapes to create a smaller shape file. Use like this:
 1) get world borders from http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php
 2) run python
      import copyshapes
      copyshapes.filter_file(
            lambda x: x.GetField('REGION') == 150,
            'TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shp', 'EUROPE.shp'
      )

 -- countries.py
 Find what countries given GPS coordinates are.
 Example:
     import countries
     cc = countries.CountryChecker('TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shp')
     print cc.getCountry(countries.Point(49.7821, 3.5708)).iso

In order to run these tools, `gdal` must be available. In order to write netCDF 
files with ISO codes, `numpy` and `netCDF4` are also required. 
Note that string variables are allowed only since netCDF version 4 - not `CLASSIC`.
